# Magic Square
An interesting challenge purposed in my System Development Course at SENAI Manuel Garcia Filho.

I had to make a Magic Square which is a square composed by 9 numbers and the sum of lines, columns and diagonals of this square will always be the same like in the picture below. I also had to use global variables :(

So I developed a program that can always make a magic square.
